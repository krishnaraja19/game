# game

1. I have used spring boot stater docker compose, so if you clone the repository,
    just run the main Java (GameApplication.java) then automatically 
    docker-compose file add MySql database.
2. Then no need to provide database config properties in application.properties file.
3. But we need to provide database details into docker-compose.
4. I have added the swagger UI features also. Please refer this link(http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/) find out the details of this application API.
5. If you have any issues to run the application please let me know. I will help you.


Thanks & Regards
